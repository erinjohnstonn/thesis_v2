Recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) or recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) was approved by the FDA in 1993 and is used to increase milk production in cows. Cows given the hormone are more prone to udder infections and thus are given more antibiotics than cows that are not treated with the hormone. Milk from cows given growth hormones contains more IGF-1 (Insulin Growth Factor-1). Humans naturally have IGF-1, but elevated levels in humans have been linked to colon and breast cancer.  <div>
