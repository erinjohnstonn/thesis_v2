“You don’t need to spend much time in an American supermarket to figure out that this is a food system organized around the objective of selling large quantities of calories as cheaply as possible,” Indeed, the word “food,” he explains, is no longer merely the definition for anything we put into our mouths at mealtimes: most items on supermarket shelves are not food at all, but imitations of food. Because of a crafty loophole in FDA regulations, they aren’t required to be labeled as such, and so we are fooled into thinking a “nutritious” sugar cereal with added vitamins and minerals is as good for us as plain oatmeal. Really it’s an alarming amalgam of chemicals, preservatives and derivatives of cheap grains: corn, soy, wheat and rice, the cornerstones of Agribusiness.
